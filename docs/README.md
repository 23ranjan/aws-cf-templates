# aws-cf-templates

Your source for free [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) templates. Bootstrap high-quality AWS infrastructure within minutes.

## Project goals and philosophy

* Accelerate the development of complex AWS infrastructure: Provide a set of common building blocks as templates that are easy to combine.
* Top-notch template quality: peer-reviewed by an expert (certified AWS solutions architect Professional) and verified with automated tests.
* Production-ready. If no other limitations are documented, templates are:
    * Highly available: no single point of failure
    * Scalable: increase or decrease the capacity based on utilization
    * Frictionless deployment: deliver new versions of your application automatically without downtime
    * Secure: using the latest operating systems and software components, follow the least privilege principle in all areas, backups enabled
    * Operator-friendly: provide tools like logging, monitoring and alerting to recognize and debug problems
* Premium Support available: Get help in case of small and big emergencies or submit a feature request.

## How it works

CloudFormation turns a template (JSON or YAML) into a stack like the following figure shows.

![CloudFormation](./img/cloudformation.png)

You can apply updates to an existing stack with an updated template. CloudFormation will figure out what needs to be changed.

> Never make manual changes to infrastructure managed by CloudFormation!

aws-cf-templates provides a collection of templates designed as common building blocks that work together. Imagine you want to set up a Jenkins automation server. You could do this in a single template. But you will soon discover that many parts of the templates are not related to Jenkins. That's why we split our templates into building blocks that you can combine in creative ways. Back to the Jenkins example. The following figure shows how four templates are used to spin up a production-ready Jenkins environment.

If you create a stack, you sometimes have to supply parameters that start with `Parent`. That's the mechanism to pass dependent stacks into a stack.

Let's look at the first dependency.

#### VPC dependency (required)

Many templates depend on a VPC stack. The VPC is a required dependency.

#### Alert dependency (optional)

If you want to receive alerts when things go wrong, you can optionally supply an alert stack.

I highly recommend using an alert stack. Otherwise, you will not know when things go wrong (and they will!).

#### SSH bastion host dependency (optional)

If you want to add some extra security, you can use an SSH bastion host.

![SSH bastion host dependency](./img/example-ssh-bastion-host.png)

The bastion host has a optional dependency on the alert stack. So if you want to receive alerts if your bastion hosts is in trouble, supply an alert stack.

#### Jenkins

Finally, you can create the Jenkins stack.

The cool thing is that you can re-use the dependencies. E.g., you can use the same SSH bastion host for Jenkins and WordPress.
